## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How It Works
1. **Server**:
    - Initializes Winsock.
    - Creates a listening socket on `port 12345`.
    - Accepts client connections and spawns threads for each client.
    - Forwards messages from one client to all others.

2. **Client**:
    - Connects to the server using IP (`127.0.0.1` for local testing).
    - Sends messages with username prefix.
    - Listens for messages from other clients using a dedicated thread.
